# DevOps-NothingToEverything
I'm starting my journey into the world of DevOps, and this repo is where I’ll be documenting everything I learn — from the very basics to more advanced tools and real-world practices.  I’ll be exploring tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Linux, AWS, Terraform, and more, and sharing my notes, setups, scripts, and practice projects here.
